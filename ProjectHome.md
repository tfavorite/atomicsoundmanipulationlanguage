Atomic Sound Manipulation Language is Team SoundHammer's solution to the problem of how to make a high level computer language that describes effects that can be applied to sound waves.  The idea is to give the programmer access to the most elemental levels of a sound's composition in an easy, intuitive way.  This elemental access to sounds is the idea from which our language derives its name, as we intended the language to operate upon sound at the "atomic" level.
> ASML will feature typical computer language constructs such as loops, if statements, comparators, and arithmetic operators. It will use these features to manipulate new primitive types based upon the most fundamental components of sound: frequency, amplitude, and time.  Programmers in ASML will be able to use these statements and operators to produce general purpose and specialized functions to act upon sound waves, their individual frequencies, and other available types.  Programmers will then be able to aggregate these functions into even more robust effects that can be intelligently triggered.
> Team SoundHammer would like ASML to bring power and ease to the manipulation of sound waves in the same way that a language like AWK makes it easy to write powerful text file manipulation programs.  We would like to have the user be able to use simple commands to open wav files, isolate frequencies and time ranges from those files, and manipulate the data therein on either a micro or a macro scale.
